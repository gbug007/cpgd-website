As a club, we work to give our members the tools and knowledge that they need to turn their game ideas into reality. We achieve this through presentations, discussions, and worskhops that revolve around game design concepts or the game development process. In addition we may run quarter-long game development projects where club members form into groups to work towards making a game over the course of the quarter. Finally, once per quarter, CPGD hosts its most exciting event, a game jam where club members either as individual or in groups attempt to create a game in as little as 24 hours!
