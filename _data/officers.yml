  description: Hi! My name is Jacob, and I'm currently in my 5th year at Cal Poly, going for my masters degree in Computer Science! I'm very interested in all of the crazy techniques games use that let them work the way they do (or sometimes not work, which is cool as well). My favorite game is Hollow Knight and I will be locking myself in my room for a week straight when Silksong releases.
